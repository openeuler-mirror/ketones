Welcome to our software! Below is a detailed description of the software,
highlighting its features and capabilities.

### Overview

Our software is a powerful eBPF program assembly designed to help users run
programs in various environments. It aims to replace the BCC toolset and
provides additional tools for observing the kernel. With a small footprint,
easy integration, and compatibility with different kernels, our software is
versatile and efficient. It supports running in container environments without
the need for installing a compilation environment.

### Key Features

**Replacement for BCC Toolset**: Our software's primary goal is to replace the
BCC toolset. We offer a set of in-house tools that provide enhanced observation
and analysis of the kernel.

**Kernel Observation Tools**: Our software includes self-developed tools
specifically designed for observing the kernel, allowing you to gain deeper
insights into the inner workings of your system.

**Rapid Fixes and Iterations**: We prioritize quick bug fixes and continuous
improvements, addressing multiple compatibility issues to ensure you always
